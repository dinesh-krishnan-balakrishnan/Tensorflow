    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "While **Autoencoders** are able to efficiently extract features from images and discarding noise, they are fairly limited when encoding representations that they haven't been trained on. When using these trained **Autoencoders** for generation, the *latent space* they convert may not be continous or allow for easy interpolation: this will result in a unrealistic generated output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "If the problem lies with the *latent space* in images, variations of an image need to be produced that transform such *latent space*. **Variational Autoencoders** do this by passing the input layer into a *Mean Vector* and *Standard Deviation* vector. By doing as such, the input layer is transformed into a distribution, which is them sampled to form the *Sampled Latent Vector*. \n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"reparameterization.png\" width=\"500px;\" alt=\"Factoring the stochastic component into a variable epsilon.\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the *Sampled Latent Vector* is *stochastic* in nature, *backpropogation* cannot be performed. To fix this, the randomness of the *Sampled Latent Vector* can be determined beforehand and kept track of as a parameter. While the algorithm is still *stochastic*, the *Sampled Latent Vector* can now be recreated. This means that the *loss function* can compare the input and output, which in turn allows for *backpropgation*."
